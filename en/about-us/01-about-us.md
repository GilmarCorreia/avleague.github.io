This is the beginning of the Autonomous Vehicle League. 

We believe that autonomous vehicles will change the world around us, making transportation safer and more available to everyone.

Our goal is to contribute to the advancements of autonomous vehicle. 

For that, we want to gather the comunity of developers, engineers and scientists together to explore the multidiciplinary challenges found on the subject of autonomous vehicles.

And also, of course, bring the attention of new people to join us on this journey of making autonomous cars part of our reality.

We plan on hosting a variety of events, such as meetings, talks and competitions, with the objective to motivate the comunity to discuss and work on challenging problems on the subject of autonomous vehicles. 

Join us and let's change the way we drive. Don't Driving :)
